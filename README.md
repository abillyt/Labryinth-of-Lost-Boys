Labyrinth-of-Lost-Boys
a text-based adventure game.
Current version includes character creation, fighting, looting, equipping, some environment interaction, and essentially a "beta" version of infinite lives (selecting YES to keeping your stats starts your character with full health at the mouth of the Battle Cave). 
The map is still incomplete, but shouldn't crash the game if you get to an uncoded portion. 

It's coded in Python 2.7

To play: 
The game will work best if you enter command words in lower case without getting cheeky.
When entering any "item" you must use the proper spelling and capitolization. 
When prompted with any option that has numbers associated with your choices, the program is expecting you to enter a number. 
You can type "player" at any time to check out your stats or inventory (to see and equip) or high scores (not fully functional yet in saving the data).
