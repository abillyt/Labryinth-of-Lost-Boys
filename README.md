Labyrinth-of-Lost-Boys; coded in Python 2.7

a text-based adventure game.

Current version includes character creation, fighting, looting, equipping, some environment interaction, and essentially a "beta" version of infinite lives (selecting YES to keeping your level and stats starts your character with full health at the entrance to the labyrinth). 
The map is still incomplete, but shouldn't crash the game if you get to an uncoded portion. 

Type "options", "inventory", "stats", "equip", "scoreboard", or "quit" at any time. 

To play: 
Answer open questions as cleanly as you are able. Any question asked with a menu of numbers, enter a number rather than the text. 
When entering any "item" you must use the proper spelling and capitolization.
