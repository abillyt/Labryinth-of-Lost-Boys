# Labyrinth-of-Lost-Boys ### *coded in Python 2.7

a text-based adventure game.

Current version includes character creation, fighting, looting, equipping, leveling up, some environment interaction, healing, inventory. There is 1 regular boss, 1 hidden boss, 1 hidden treasure, & 4 boys to save (out of 12 total to be programmed), 

Since this is essentially a "running" version there will be the option on death of keeping your level and stats and starting your character with full health at the entrance to the labyrinth. *considering adding a permanent feature of the player having 3 lives. 

The map is still incomplete, but shouldn't crash the game if you get to an uncoded portion. 

Type "options", "inventory", "stats", "equip", "scoreboard", or "quit" at any time. 

To play: 
Answering questions casually mostly works. Any question asked with a menu of numbers, enter a number rather than the text. 
When entering any "item" for using or equipping you must use the proper spelling and capitolization.
