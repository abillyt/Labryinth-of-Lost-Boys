# Labyrinth-of-Lost-Boys 
*Coded in Python 3.7 by abillyt*

A text-based adventure game.

### What does the current version include?

The current version of Labyrinth of Lost Boys includes character creation, fighting, looting, equipping, leveling up, some environment interaction, healing, inventory. 

#### Notes:

There is 1 regular boss, 1 hidden boss, 1 hidden treasure, & 4 boys to save (out of 12 total to be programmed), 

Since this is essentially a "running" version there will be the option on death of keeping your level and stats and starting your character with full health at the entrance to the labyrinth. *considering adding a permanent feature of the player having 3 lives.*

The map is still incomplete, but shouldn't crash the game if you get to an uncoded portion. 

Type "options", "inventory", "stats", "equip", "scoreboard", or "quit" at any time. 

Well coded areas of the game: looting, battling, equipping, stats, menus, navigating the labyrinth
Iffy/untested areas of the game: vendor interaction, using items correctly, boss fights, elite loots

#### To play: 
Answering questions casually mostly works. Any question asked with a menu of numbers, enter a number rather than the text. 
When entering any "item" for using or equipping you must use the proper spelling and capitolization.
