Labyrinth-of-Lost-Boys; coded in Python 2.7

a text-based adventure game.

Current version includes character creation, fighting, looting, equipping, leveling up, and some environment interaction. There is 1 regular boss, 1 hidden boss, 3 boys to save (out of 12 total to be programmed), 

Since this is essentially a "running" version there will be the option on death of keeping your level and stats and starting your character with full health at the entrance to the labyrinth. 

The map is still incomplete, but shouldn't crash the game if you get to an uncoded portion. 

Type "options", "inventory", "stats", "equip", "scoreboard", or "quit" at any time. 

To play: 
Answering questions casually works to some extent. Any question asked with a menu of numbers, enter a number rather than the text. 
When entering any "item" you must use the proper spelling and capitolization.
